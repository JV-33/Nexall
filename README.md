    Project Overview
The project was created purely for technical demonstration, aiming to showcase all functionalities. Due to the deadline constraints, I couldn't complete the testing phase for the entire project. However, my primary focus is on beck-end testing. I'd like to improve data retrieval as well as data loading to ensure faster performance of the application. The current user interface is kept simple. Given more time, I would dedicate additional effort to make it more engaging from a marketing perspective.
